# Basic Probability Questions -- Use R as a calculator and specify the
# answers below

# A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards, with 13 cards from each 
#   suit (hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades).
 
#1. If one card is selected at random, what is the probability that 

#  (a) the card is the ace of spades?

1/52

#  (b) the card is NOT the ace of spades?

51/52

#  (c) the card is an ace (of any suit)?

1/12

#  (d) the card is an ace OR a 4?

2/14

# Use R to answer the remaining questions. You MUST use R to 
# enumerate and analyze the sample space or to carry out 
# probability experiments (simulations) in order to calculate
# an empirical probability.


#2. This question looks at the probability of rolling two dice
#   (each with values 1 - 6) and getting a sum of 7.
#   You will answer this question in parts.

#  (a) Use the 'permutations' function from 'gtools'
#      to enumerate the sample space obtained by rolling two dice.
#      (Note: the correct sample space has 36 outcomes)

d<-permutations(6,2,c(1:6),repeats.allowed = T)
d

#  (b) Use R and your answer to (a) to find the number of outcomes 
#      where the sum is 7
index <- rowSums(d)==7
index
nrow(d[index,])

#  (c) divide your answer from (b) by the size of the sample space
#      to find the probability that the sum is 7.
nrow(d[index,])/nrow(d)

#3. Calculate the same probability in (2) but by finding the empirical 
#   probability by completing the steps below.

#   (a) Write a function that rolls two dice and returns the sum of the 
#       die rolls (this is done for you)

      roll2 <- function() {
        s <- sample(1:6, 2, replace = TRUE)
        c(sum(s))
      }


#   (b) Use the 'replicate' function to roll two dice 5000 times, to
#       get a vector containing the sum of die rolls for each experiment.

v<-c(replicate(5000, roll2))
v
#   (c) Find the number of times you rolled a seven, and divide by the 
#       number of experiments to find the empirical probability

count <- 0
  for (val in v){
    if(v == 7) count = count+1
  }
  print(count)

count/length(v)
# Definition: A probability distribution of a discrete random variable 
# gives the probability for each value that the variable can take. For 
# example, if we flip a coin three times, and let X = the number of heads,
# then the probability distribution of X is given by the following code:

pdist <- cbind(X = 0:3, 'P(X)' = c(0.125,0.375, 0.375, 0.125))
pdist

# In other words, P(X = 0) is 0.125, which says that the probability of 
# getting no heads (or all tails) is 0.125. You will derive the above
# probability distribution in the next problem.


#4. We will look at flipping a coin 3 times and letting X = the
#   number of heads. Find the probability distribution of X by
#   completing the steps below:

#   (a) Use the 'permutations' function to enumerate the sample
#       space obtained from flipping a coin 3 times.

S <- permutations(2,3, c("H", "T"), repeats = TRUE)

#   (b) Using your sample space, find X = the number of heads for each
#       set of 3 coins. 
x <- (S == "H")
length(S[x])

#   (c) Create a relative frequency table for X, which is the probability
#       distribution of X = the number of heads in 3 coin tosses.

f <- prop.table(x)
f
#   (d) Create a bar graph of the relative frequencies, using ggplot and
#       labeling the x-axis, y-axis, and title.
library(ggplot2)
counts <- data.frame(f)
counts
ggplot(counts) + geom_bar(aes(counts, fill = counts)) + 
  ggtitle("Outcome of flipping a coin 3 times") +
  labs(x = "outcome", y = "Frequency") + theme_bw()

#5. Find the empirical distribution of X = the number of heads in 3
#   coin tosses by completing the steps below. 

#   (a) Write a function that flips a coin 3 times and returns the number
#       of heads



#   (b) Use the 'replicate' function to repeat 3 coin tosses 5000 times, to
#       get a vector containing the number of heads for each experiment


#   (c) Create a relative frequency table for the number of heads. This is
#       the empirical probability distribution of X = the number of heads
#       in 3 coin tosses.

#   Poker Time! The commands below enumerate the sample space of
#   all possible poker hands. Here we ignore the suit because is not 
#   needed for the questions below.  We also use combinations 
#   instead of permutations. Combinations should be used when the
#   order does not matter (e.g., which is true for the order of cards
#   in a hand). The cards are sampled WITHOUT replacement 
#   (repeats.allowed = FALSE) because we cannot include
#   the same card twice in one hand. Finally, we specify 'set = FALSE' to 
#   allow for duplicate values in the deck vector. Each combination 
#   (hand) is equally likely, so classical probability can be used.
######################################################################

deck <- rep(1:13,4)
hands <- combinations(52, 5, deck, repeats.allowed = FALSE, set = FALSE)

#6. How many possible poker hands are there?


#7. The function below takes a vector (corresponding to a hand of cards)
#   and returns TRUE if the hand contains a four-of-a-kind
#   Use 'apply' to apply this function to each hand, in order to show
#   that the probability of being dealt a four-of-a-kind is
#   approximately 0.00024 (or 1/4165). Note: You MUST use the
#   apply function and the four.of.a.kind function below to find this. 
#   Because the hands matrix contains more than 2.5 million rows, 
#   this calculation may take several minutes. You should therefore test 
#   your code on a subset of the hands matrix first. There are two 4-of-a-kinds
#   if you look at the first 20,000 rows.

##############################################################
# this function returns true if a hand contains a 4-of-a-kind
##############################################################
four.of.a.kind <- function(x) {
  t <- table(x)  # frequency table for cards in the hand
  m <- max(t)    # how frequent is the most common card?
  if (m == 4) return (TRUE)
  return (FALSE)
}


v <- apply(hands, 1, four.of.a.kind)

#8. Create a function that determines whether a vector 'x' contains 
#   a full house (i.e., 3 of a kind and 1 pair). You can assume
#   that 'x' includes exactly 5 cards.


#9. Show that the probability of being dealt a full house is 
#    approximately 0.00144 (roughly 1/694). Note for testing purposes,
#    that there are 18 full houses in the first 20,000 rows of the
#    hands matrix
